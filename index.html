</td>

<td align="justify">I am currently a Research Scientist at McAfee Labs, Bangalore. I love to read and write. In my free time, I write a <a href="http://blog.romanch.com">blog</a> where I write short stories on various genres and articles on human understanding and awareness (something happened to my blog when the website where I was hosting it was closed down. I am trying to get backup. Sorry for the inconvenience.). I love to solve problems. My resume can be found <a href="romanch_resume.pdf">here</a> which describes the technical side of me. In case you would like to contact me, email is the fastest way.</td>

<h1>Being a Researcher</h1>
</td>

<td align="justify">Being a researcher for the past six years has given me a new perspective to look at things. Before getting into research my methods were to directly indulge into the problem and look for the solution. In the past five years I have gained the sensibility to read and understand what others have done in the past and then find a solution to the problem. I am a lot more patient than what I was years ago. Research has also provided me an understanding to decide problems which are worth devoting time. It has also helped me to understand what interests me. As a whole it has helped me develop into a better being.</td>

I am just intrigued by the possibilities that Computers have brought and will keep bringing in our lives. I was attracted towards research because it provided me a platform to do something new which can bring value to the world. At heart, I am a problem solver. My research interests are in -
